				  <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acne and excessive hair growth can significantly impact the complexion and overall self-esteem of youngsters, creating a tumultuous journey through adolescence and early adulthood. The appearance of acne, characterized by pimples, blackheads, and deeper lumps, mars the skin's smoothness, often leaving behind scars or dark spots that serve as a lasting reminder of the struggle for clear skin. Similarly, excessive hair growth, medically known as hirsutism, can cause unwanted hair on the face, back, and chest, leading to feelings of self-consciousness and distress. These skin conditions do more than just alter one’s appearance; they deeply affect an individual's perception of self, fostering insecurities and a diminished sense of self-worth. Let’s learn more about them.</p>

					<h3>Acne</h3>					
					<p  class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Acne is a red, irritating skin rash primarily affecting teenagers and young adults. Acne is mostly caused by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stress</li>
						<li>Changing hormone levels before menstruation</li>
						<li>Oil from skin products (moisturizers or cosmetics) </li>
						<li>Environmental irritants (pollution and high humidity)</li>
						<li>Squeezing or picking at blemishes</li>
						<li>Hard scrubbing of the skin</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Acne can generally be successfully treated with a variety of topical and oral medications. While inflammatory acne often requires the chronic use of antibiotics by way of the mouth, topical treatments must be taken only by a certified dermatologist.</p>
					
					
					<h3>Special Acne Treatments at Angel Healthcare</h3>
					<p>Our treatments are customized for every individual. Our exclusive topical treatment includes cleansing of the face (or the body region affected by acne), application of an AHA mask (prepared from natural fruit extracts), comedo extraction (to prevent scarring), and the application of a cooling mask (made of herbal medicines and aromatic oils).</p>
					<p>This surgery also helps in the elimination of blackheads and whiteheads. Make sure to not pick, scratch, pop, or squeeze pimples yourself as it leads to more redness, swelling, and inflammation.</p>
					
					<h3>Microdermabrasion</h3>
					<p>Microdermabrasion removes the upper layers of the skin, improving irregularities on the surface, contouring, and generating new skin.</p>
					
					<h3>Laser Acne Treatment</h3>
					<p>Laser treatment can usually lead to a lessening of the amount of required antibiotics. It not only improves inflamed acne but also improves acne scars.</p>
					<p>Most patients require approximately 5-7 rounds of treatment to see the desired improvement. Periodic re-treatments will be needed, since acne flares. Improvements are guaranteed, but time and degree of result vary from skin to skin.</p>
					
					<h3>Excessive/Unwanted Hair in Women</h3>
					<p>The normal amount of body hair varies widely among women. Usually, a woman will only grow fine hair (peach fuzz) on her lips, chin, chest, abdomen, or back. In some cases, women grow coarse, dark hairs in these areas owing to a condition called hirsutism - a pattern of hair growth that is more typical in men.</p>
					<p>So, why does hirsutism occur in women? It is caused by too much of male hormones (androgens) present in the body, often a pattern that runs across generations. While it is a harmless condition, it may cause embarrassment to the person affected.</p>

					<h3>Laser Photo Rejuvenation</h3>
					<p>Laser Photo Rejuvenation is a new treatment to help the skin look firmer and smoother. A non-invasive laser treatment, it is designed for people who are too busy or do not wish to go through the recovery time of deeper laser resurfacing.</p>
					
					<p>This treatment utilizes two or more lasers that specifically target vascular (superficial blood vessels) and pigment changes (brown discolouration or spots), wrinkles, scars in our skin that develop with age, and sun damage, to provide you with healthy, younger-looking skin. It can be taken up by people aged 18 and above.</p>
					
					<p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Benefits of Photorejuvenation:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>No downtime</li>
						<li>Healthier looking skin</li>
						<li>Smoother skin</li>
						<li>Reduced pore size</li>
						<li>Even skin tone</li>
						<li>Reduced redness and flushing</li>
						<li>Reduced wrinkles</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The treatment lasts 45 minutes and patients are advised to take multiple rounds (3-4 treatments at monthly intervals) to achieve optimal results. Improvement here is gradual, since the treatment not only improves skin texture and color, but also stimulates the regeneration of collagen cells.,</p>
					<p>Acne needs to be treated as seriously as any other skin problem and must be tackled at the early onset for quick results. If treated correctly, it is 100% curable!</p>
