				  <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Laser hair removal is one of the most popular non-surgical cosmetic procedures. However, as laser hair removal procedures grow in popularity, consumers must realize it is still a serious procedure with potentially harmful risks and side effects.</p>
				  <p><strong>The good news</strong> is with today's latest technologies, the risks are potentially minimized. However, this doesn’t eliminate the threat of old laser technologies being used, that too by unqualified and untrained professionals. </p>
				  <p>Based on several years of working with laser machines, we have put forward a list of  Do’s and Don’t’s:</p>
				   
					<h3>Do’s</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>Find the right clinic to perform the treatments, because not all clinics are equipped to carry out laser hair removal</li>
					  <li>Consult a qualified physician: Consumers should be cautious of non-physicians practicing these procedures in spas/salons. Only a physician who is certified in dermatology or another specialty with equivalent training and experience should perform this procedure.</li>
					  <li>Research on the net and find out the best machines available if possible. It will make life easier for you, as laser treatments are not cheap.</li>
					  <li>Ask questions to your dermatologist: <br>
						<ul>
						  <li>What kind of training or experience do they have?</li>
						  <li>What types of lasers do they use?</li>
						  <li>Do they have the latest technologies?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Tip: Nd:YAG technology-based machines are the most superior versions for laser treatment</p>
					  </li>
					  <li>Ask for some client references</li>
					  <li>Ask if emergency medicinal kits are available in case of reactions or accidents</li>
					  <li>Check the room for adequate air conditioning (Must for laser treatments) and proper earthing systems to avoid electrical shocks</li>
					  <li>Undergo a skin test: If there are any apprehensions as to how the laser may interact with the skin, ask for a skin test to ensure there will be no adverse side effects</li>
					  <li>Use regular sunscreens and enough moisturizers after laser treatment</li>
					  <li>Check if the clinic has ISO certifications or other accreditations to ensure quality and a risk-free environment for your treatment</li>
					</ul>

				  	<h3>Don’ts</h3>
				  
					<ul>
					  <li>Remove ornaments or dentures to avoid electrical interference with the laser machines</li>
					  <li>Don&rsquo;t use make-up, bleach, or waxing before treatment</li>
					  <li>Don&rsquo;t expose yourself to the sun 2 days before treatments.</li>
					  <li>No hot water bathing 12 hrs before treatment.</li>
					  <li>Avoid swimming as it tends to tan the skin and treatments would not be effective</li>
					  <li>Don&rsquo;t seek laser treatments for white hair or hair in darker areas with a conventional laser technique. These require special Ultrasonic Machines, which usually work as a plucker to permanently remove these types of hair</li>
					  <li>Don&rsquo;t undergo laser procedures if you take light-sensitive medication. Some medications may interfere with laser procedures, making the skin more susceptible to burning and scarring. Consult a physician before undergoing the laser treatment</li>
					  <li>Raise a concern about discomfort or any other matter, as communication is an essential part of the entire laser hair removal process</li>
					  <li>Don&rsquo;t get into the trap of clinics offering laser treatments at throwaway prices. They may be using outdated technologies or cheap machines, which could do more harm to your skin or would never address your problem</li>
					  <li>Do not hesitate to lodge your grievances on the net with government-certified consumer-related forums or the consumer court</li>
					</ul>
