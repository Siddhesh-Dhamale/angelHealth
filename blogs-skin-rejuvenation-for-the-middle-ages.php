				  <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Skin care needs to change as you age - with time, your skin loses collagen, a strong fibrous substance that helps give skin its firm, tight appearance. The loss of collagen results in wrinkles and loss of skin tone. Your skin also tends to dry out as you age and the loss of moisture also contributes to an aged look. Lastly, after many years in the sun, the damage starts to become visible during this time: the culprits include wrinkles, discoloration, and sagging of the body.</p>
				  <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Dry skin has a low level of sebum, which is the skin's natural lubricator. As it doesn't have enough sebum, it dries out simply and isn't able to keep the correct amount of moisture required for unblemished skin. Don't worry, it's never too late to begin!</p>

					<h2>Get your Glow Back: <br> A  6-step Bio-techno facial rejuvenation program designed for sure shot results for any type of skin, age, color</h2>	
					
					<h3><small>Step 1</small> <br> Exfoliation</h3>
					<p>An exfoliation routine consists of topical exfoliating creams and microdermabrasion or superficial chemical peels with glycolic or salicylic acid. The latter peels are time-consuming procedures by which you leave the clinic a little pink, but with a refreshed glow.</p>
					
					<h3><small>Step 2</small> <br> Stimulate New Collagen Formation</h3>
					<p>Most important step for the removal of static facial wrinkles and fine lines. There is no quick non-surgical way to remove visible facial wrinkles. Laser resurfacing can quickly and effectively remove facial wrinkles. However, laser resurfacing is unacceptable for most people due to its prolonged recovery.</p>
					
					<h3><small>Step 3</small> <br> Removal of Abnormal Pigment and Blood Vessels</h3>
					<p>Although creams and exfoliation can remove many light brown spots and the lasers used in step 2 remove smaller vessels, more aggressive therapy is needed for the removal of darker pigment, brown spots, and larger vessels.  A newer laser called the Cool Glide is very effective for larger blood vessels. Today the IPL is the choice for combined pigment and smaller blood vessels that appear as a flush similar to Rosacea. The above therapies are effective and results are visible in about six weeks. Usually, two or three treatments are needed.</p>
					
					<h3><small>Step 4</small> <br> Relaxation of Muscles of Facial Expression</h3>
					<p>Botox is a revolutionary new drug, which effectively removes dynamic lines and wrinkles caused by the muscles of facial expression. The frown lines, worry lines, crow's feet, and bunny lines all may be lessened or removed by the injection of Botox. Lipstick lines, the fine wrinkles around the lips may also be lessened with Botox but only small amounts can be used otherwise the lips will be weakened.</p>
					
					<h3><small>Step 5</small> <br> Fill Deep Facial Lines and Contour Deformities</h3>
					<p>Soft tissue fillers such as Radiesse, Restylane, your fat, and other fillers can be injected into the skin beneath a deep facial line to plump the line and camouflage the line. They may also be used to plump the aging lip and to fill contour deformities caused by facial aging. These fillers are temporary and must be repeated every six months to a year.</p>
					
					<h3><small>Step 6</small> <br> Skin Tightening</h3>
					<p>Skin tightening is a very important component of any facial rejuvenation process. Latest technologies using Infrared Radiofrequency and combined laser energy are showing promising results as non-surgical skin tightening methods.</p>
					<p>Apart from the treatment, there are important things one can do to manage life better:</p>

							<h4>Drink Enough Water</h4>
							<p>Good skin is a reflection of a good digestive system. People with skin disorders often suffer from constipation and digestive disorders. Drinking water bathes cells and eliminates waste products, preventing constipation.</p>

							<h4>Eat Enough Fiber</h4>
